House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Project Overview



This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict house prices using selected features from the Kaggle housing dataset.

The model predicts the SalePrice of a house based on:



Ground Living Area (GrLivArea)



Number of Bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr)



Number of Bathrooms (FullBath)



The goal of this project is to understand the implementation of linear regression using Python and scikit-learn.
